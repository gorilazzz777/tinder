# Tinder app script
This script allows you to automatically put likes in the tinder app.
To configure it, you only need to enter your credentials in .env and, if necessary, change the names of the buttons (if our version is not in Russian)

The script puts likes only to those who are in the status of "recently active" (for more conversion)
